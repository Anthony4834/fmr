Here’s the comprehensive report on integrating estimated actual market rent (AMR) into fmr.fyi and its effect on Section 8 payouts:
Incorporating Estimated Actual Market Rent (AMR) into the fmr.fyi Application
Section 8 payment standards and the role of market rent

How payment standards are determined – HUD publishes Fair Market Rents (FMRs) each year to represent the 40th‑percentile gross rent for modest units at the county or ZIP level. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) must set voucher payment standards between 90 % and 110 % of FMR; high‑cost areas may receive HUD permission to use exceptions up to 120 % or higher. The payment standard is not the rent landlords receive – it is the maximum subsidy the PHA will pay. Tenants normally contribute 30 % of their income toward rent, and the voucher covers the difference between that amount and the lower of the contract rent (market rent) and the payment standard. Some PHAs, such as the District of Columbia Housing Authority, set payment standards well above 100 % FMR (e.g., 187 % FMR for FY 2026) but still enforce rent‑reasonableness tests.

Rent reasonableness and estimated market rent (AMR) – PHAs are required to ensure that voucher rents are reasonable compared with rents for similar unassisted units in the same market. For new vouchers, a unit is affordable only if the tenant’s portion does not exceed 40 % of their monthly income. Housing authorities compare the proposed rent to at least two comparable unassisted units, considering location, unit type, size, amenities and utilities. If the contract rent is above the local market rent, the landlord must reduce it to the market level even if FMR would allow more. Thus the voucher will pay at most the lower of (payment standard, market rent). In project‑based Section 8 renewals, HUD requires a Rent Comparability Study (RCS) where an appraiser analyzes comparable properties, adjusts for differences and calculates an estimated market rent for each unit type. HUD recently revised its renewal rules, ordering a HUD‑commissioned RCS only when requested rents exceed 150 % of the Small Area FMR (SAFMR).

Why FMR often differs from actual market rent – FMR reflects the 40th‑percentile rent and therefore lags hot markets; actual market rents are often higher. Articles aimed at landlords advise checking real‑time rent indices such as the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) and comparable listings in addition to FMR; these market indices are better proxies for current rents. In practice, PHAs rely on market comparables to verify rent reasonableness. If the market rent is lower than FMR, the voucher will only cover market rent; if it is higher, the voucher is capped at the payment standard.

How estimated market rent (AMR) affects Section 8 payout

The interaction between FMR‑based payment standards and market rent can be described as:

Scenario	Effect on Section 8 payout	Evidence
Market rent ≤ payment standard	The contract rent must be reasonable relative to comparable unassisted units; the landlord may charge no more than the market rent, even if FMR would allow a higher payment. The PHA pays up to the market rent; the tenant pays 30 % of income.	CMHA explains that gross rent must be reasonable compared with comparable unassisted units and “rent reasonableness is defined as one that does not exceed gross rent charged for comparable unassisted units”.
Market rent > payment standard	The PHA will pay up to the payment standard. Any difference between the payment standard and the higher market rent must be paid by the tenant (subject to income limits) or negotiated down by the landlord; otherwise the unit is unaffordable and cannot be approved.	HUD guidance notes that PHAs set payment standards within 90–110 % of FMR and that voucher holders pay the difference if contract rent exceeds the payment standard; CMHA states that if the requested rent causes the tenant share to exceed 40 % of income, the housing authority negotiates a lower rent.
High‑cost areas/exception payment standards	PHAs may request exception payment standards above 110 % of FMR when market rents are significantly higher. For example, the District of Columbia Housing Authority uses payment standards of up to 187 % of FMR for FY 2026. Even then, the rent must not exceed what is considered reasonable.	DCHA’s FY 2026 payment standards set maximum payments up to 187 % of FMR and note that all rents are still subject to rent‑reasonableness standards.

Implication for investors: FMR alone can over‑estimate or under‑estimate Section 8 rental income. If AMR < FMR, the voucher will pay only AMR; if AMR > FMR, the voucher is capped at roughly 100 % FMR (unless local PHAs adopt higher payment standards). Understanding the gap between market rent and FMR helps investors predict whether Section 8 will fully cover market rents or whether tenants will need to pay extra. Additionally, market rent gives insight into general rental yield potential outside of Section 8.

Proposed integration of AMR into fmr.fyi

The fmr.fyi website currently presents HUD FMR/SAFMR values, trends and a purchase‑price calculator. To incorporate Estimated Actual Market Rent (AMR) and better reflect Section 8 payout dynamics, the following features could be added:

1. Display AMR alongside FMR

AMR data source. Use a reliable market‑rent index such as Zillow’s Observed Rent Index (ZORI) (available at the ZIP level) or similar datasets (Apartment List, CoStar). ZORI represents the mean rent for listings in the 35th–65th percentile range. Alternatively, the site could allow users to supply their own AMR estimate.

“FMR vs AMR” table. Next to the existing bedroom‑level FMR table, add a column showing estimated market rent for each bedroom (AMR). The table should also display the ratio (FMR ÷ AMR) so users can quickly see whether the voucher limit is above or below market rent.

Visual comparison. Include a simple bar chart or curve comparing FMR, the standard payment range (90–110 % of FMR), and AMR. This can highlight when market rents exceed voucher limits. For example, the illustrative chart below shows a 2‑bedroom unit in ZIP 36110 where FMR is $960 and estimated market rent is $1,200; the voucher payment standard (100 % FMR) would not fully cover the market rent, creating a gap.

2. Section 8 payout estimator

Payment standard slider. Because PHAs can set payment standards from 90 %–110 % of FMR (or higher in exception areas), include a slider or input allowing users to adjust the payment‑standard multiplier (default = 100 %).

Expected voucher rent. For each bedroom, calculate the expected Section 8 contract rent as

Section 8 rent
=
min
⁡
(
AMR
,
  
Payment Standard
)
Section 8 rent=min(AMR,Payment Standard).

This reflects that the housing authority will pay up to the payment standard but not more than market rent. Display the Section 8 rent, the potential gap (AMR – payment standard), and note that final rents are subject to rent‑reasonableness reviews.

Tenant share estimate. Optionally estimate the tenant’s share (30 % of assumed income) and how much the tenant would need to pay if the market rent exceeds the payment standard.

3. Update the purchase price calculator

Rent source selection. Add options for users to choose Section 8 FMR, Actual Market (AMR) or Expected Section 8 rent as the monthly rent input. When the user selects Section 8, default to the expected Section 8 rent computed above; when they select market, use AMR.

Cash‑flow yield sensitivity. Show how cash flow and maximum purchase price change under different rent scenarios. For example, a property might cash‑flow under Section 8 rents but yield higher returns if leased at market rates.

4. Adjust the investment score

The current investment score uses FMR to compute net yield and adjusts for demand using Zillow’s demand indices. To reflect market‑rent realities, consider the following adjustments:

Dual scores. Provide two scores per location:

Section 8 score (FMR‑based) – uses the original formula and FMR to estimate net yield; this helps investors targeting voucher tenants.

Market score (AMR‑based) – replaces the rent input with AMR (or the expected Section 8 rent, if AMR < payment standard) to estimate net yield for market‑rate tenants or voucher tenants subject to rent reasonableness.

AMR adjustment factor. Alternatively, include an adjustment that scales the base score by the ratio of expected Section 8 rent to FMR:

Adjusted score
=
Base score
×
(
min
⁡
(
AMR
,
  
Payment Standard
)
FMR
)
Adjusted score=Base score×(
FMR
min(AMR,Payment Standard)
	​

).

When market rent is higher than FMR but still within the payment standard (e.g., 110 % of FMR), the score increases; when market rent is lower, the score decreases. This keeps the score within the same scale (capped at 300) while reflecting market‑rent realities.

5. Context and caveats

Local variation. Payment standards and rent reasonableness vary by PHA. The application should remind users to verify local payment standards and rent reasonableness policies; some PHAs adopt high exception standards (e.g., DCHA’s 187 % FMR) while others stay close to 100 %.

Data freshness. Market rent indices should be updated frequently (e.g., monthly) to capture current conditions; FMRs are updated annually. Display the date of the latest AMR data and provide a link to the source.

Limitations. AMR is an estimate of the average market rent; actual rent reasonableness evaluations use comps for similar units and may adjust for specific amenities. Investors should treat the AMR features as screening tools rather than definitive pro formas.

Conclusion

Integrating estimated actual market rent (AMR) into fmr.fyi enhances the platform’s ability to model Section 8 rental income. By showing AMR alongside FMR, estimating how payment standards interact with market rents and updating investment scores accordingly, the site can better inform investors about both voucher‑based and market‑rate opportunities. This dual‑view respects HUD regulations—PHAs must ensure rents are reasonable—and acknowledges that the housing market often diverges from HUD’s FMR benchmarks.

The report details how payment standards are tied to Fair Market Rents (FMRs), why PHAs must ensure rent reasonableness, and how actual market rents often differ from FMR benchmarks. It explains the scenarios where AMR is below or above the payment standard and the implications for voucher payouts, using recent examples and HUD guidance.

It then proposes a set of feature enhancements for fmr.fyi, including adding AMR data alongside FMR, visual comparisons, a Section 8 payout estimator that uses min(AMR, Payment Standard), and an updated purchase price calculator. It also suggests refining the investment score with an AMR adjustment. These changes would help investors understand both voucher-driven and market-driven returns while reminding them of local variations and rent-reasonableness rules.
