Instant Cash Flow Analysis and FMR Data on Real Estate Listings

fmr.fyi is a Chrome extension that helps investors, property managers, and homebuyers evaluate rental properties while browsing real estate listings. Choose between two display modes: view monthly cash flow calculations or display Fair Market Rent (FMR) data directly on supported sites, eliminating the need for manual calculations or separate tools.

The extension detects property details such as address, price, bedroom count, and HOA fees, then shows an on-page indicator based on your selected mode. In Cash Flow mode, you'll see estimated monthly cash flow calculations. In FMR mode, you'll see the Fair Market Rent value for the property. Selecting the indicator opens a detailed analysis view with HUD FMR and Small Area FMR data, local tax rates, mortgage assumptions, and customizable expense inputs.
