### Transform Your Real Estate Research with Instant Cash Flow Analysis

**fmr.fyi** is the essential Chrome extension for real estate investors, property managers, and anyone evaluating rental property opportunities. Choose between Cash Flow mode for detailed financial analysis or FMR mode for quick rent reference.

### 🎯 What It Does

The extension automatically detects property information (address, price, bedrooms, HOA fees) from real estate listing pages and displays a smart badge next to each property.
